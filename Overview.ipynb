    "Probably you should have heard a lot about \"Machine Learning\" so far, and fairly you might have asked yourself: What does it mean? Machine Learning lies in the intersection between computer science and statistics/mathematics. It uses algorithmic concepts from computer science together with mathematical models to describe the data and be able to find meaningful patterns present. Thus, **the main goal of Machine Learning is to extract \"meaning\" from data**. This \"meaning\" is in practice represented as a **mathematical equation that best describes the data**. In a philosophical perspective, Machine Learning is used to get knowledge from data. By using this extracted knowledge it is possible to make useful predictions.\n",

Some simple examples in your everyday lives would be the face-detection features in our smartphones, the voice assistants in our electronic devices, spam filters in our emails, etc. Other areas were the usage of machine learning is gathering momentum is medicine: machine learning algorithms can detect diseases with an accuracy similar to that of doctors, they can also be used to predict efficiency of different drug combinations which normally is an extremely time-consuming process."

    "[Figure 1](#ml-model) shows a high level view of the process of building a machine learning model. As you can see, there are 3 big parts: **the input data**, **the machine learning model** and the **predicted output**. The **input data** is fed into the model so that it can learn a good mathematical representation of it. The **process of building the model** consist of several  steps. When we build the model, we do not give it all the data that we have. We split the data into the training data and the test data. The reasons will become evident in [the train-test split section below](#train-test-split). Then we choose a specific machine learning model. **The model is trained on the training data**. After the model training si done, we can use it to predict some results on the test data, outputing the **predicted outputs**. Given model predictions, we can check how the model has performed. As you can see, there is a cycle between the testing and learning phase. This happens because we iteratively train the model, check how it performs on unseen data and then, if the results are not good we go back to training and repeat the process until we reach some satisfactory results. When it reaches an optimal performance we assume the model is ready to be used in real world scenarions.\n",
    "How do we determine whether a model is performing well or how do we measure the performance it depends on the task at hand. We will see some examples later on.\n"

    "In the case of quality control, machine learning models can help people  to identify flaws in the food production process that may be related to contamination or other defects. When it comes to sensory analysis, machine learning models can use past data to understand consumer preferences and give suggestions on new products that can be developed. Machine learning can be useful in case of food safety as well since they can be used to analyze data from microbiological test results to predict possible contamination scenarios. Lastly, it can help taylor the product development to not only make it efficient, but to also find trends and customer preferences in order to maximize profits.\n",

It is the same as building a mathematical equation or formula with many input variables in order to be able to derive the desired output variable. The data points that the model uses to learn, already have the corresponding outputs. This is how the model is able to derive a connection between inputs and outputs. There are two types of problems in the supervised setting: *regression* and *classification*. In **regression**, the output that the model learns and then tries to predict is a continuous value (e.g learning age, height of people, etc). In **classification**, the output that the model learns and then tries to predict is a categorical value (e.g a class from a finite number of classes like the whether a tumor cell is benign or malignant). \n"

    "**Unsupervised Learning** - in this setting, the data that we have does not have any values or categories that we can learn and later predict. Here, the models will try to find a structure in the data, or learn patterns present. Some use cases of such models would be: clustering, dimensionality reduction, data generation, anomaly detection etc. In the case of clustering, we try to find groups within the data, so that we can group similar samples together. In the case of dimensionality reduction, we move from data with many features, to compressed data, with very few features. While as the name suggests, in the case of data generation, we use the unlabelled data to learn a structure or underlying properties and based on this, the model will be generate similar samples. For anomaly detection, we can use machine learning models to find outliers in the data. Outliers are points that do not resemble the majority of the points in the dataset. [Fig 4](#unsup_lear) illustrates the idea. Still there is an output from the models and it outputs what the model has learned from the data. In the case of clustering, it will output a cluster number that will show with which other samples a specific sample is most similar to. In the case of dimensionality reduction, the output will be the sample but with less features. "

    "Although in practice it happens after the real data preprocessing, sometimes it is considered to be part of the data pre-pprocessing phase. As you can see from [Fig. 5](#train_test), before the machine learning model is trained, the data is split in two parts: the **training data** and the **testing data**. Usually we use 70-80% of the whole dataset for training and the remaining 20-30% for testing. The reason that we do this is to be able to quantify how well the model has learned the characteristics of the data. If the performance indicators will be great in the test part than we know that the model has learned the data well. If we see that performance indicators show poor results on the test set that this means that our model might have just \"learned by heart\"."

When you go and sit in an exam, you rarely or never find exactly the same questions that you have seen during the exercise sessions or classes. Also, you never know in advance which questions will be asked in the exam. The reason for all this constraints is that the professors want to evaluate you based on what you have understood from the course. If you already knew the questions of the exam you can easily prepare them beforehand, try to memorize the answers even if you understand nothing and then you get a really good grade from the course. But what happens next is that when you start working outside the doors of the university, you will probably not be able to solve the tasks at hand because of lack of understanding of certain concepts and set of skills. \n",

In our analogy from above, if the students understand the concepts and can put them to practice, then they can be flexible in their jobs and solve tasks that they might not have encountered during the studies.

    "We pass three arguments to the method. The first one is the dataset that will be split. The second one `test_size` determines teh portion of the data that will be used for testing. Here we specify that `20%=0.2` will be used for testing, thus implicitly the remaining 80% for training. The method, depending on whether we pass the whole dataset or the features and the labels separately, will return 2 new dataframes in the first case (1x for the train set and 1x for the test set) or 4 new dataframes in the second case (1x for the train_features, 1x for the test features, 1x for the train labels and 1x for the test labels). The third argument, `random_state=0` makes sure that no matter how many times we execute the above code cell, it will produce the same split all the times. This means that the `train_set` and `test_set` will always have the same samples. If we omit that argument, then `train_set` and `test_set` will have different samples each time we execute the cell.\n",
