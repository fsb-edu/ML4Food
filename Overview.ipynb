    "Probably you should have heard a lot about \"Machine Learning\" so far, and fairly you might have asked yourself: What does it mean? Machine Learning lies in the intersection between computer science and statistics/mathematics. The first to coin a definition for machine learning was Arthur Samuel in 1959. According to Samuel, ***\"machine learning is the field of study  that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\"***.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main goal of Machine Learning is to extract \"meaning\" from data**. This \"meaning\" is in practice represented as a **mathematical equation that best describes the data**. In a philosophical perspective, Machine Learning is used to get knowledge from data. By using this extracted knowledge it is possible to make useful predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although sometimes it might not be evident, machine learning algorithms are vastly part of our lives. Some simple examples in your everyday lives would be the face-detection features in our smartphones, the voice assistants in our electronic devices, spam filters in our emails, etc. Other areas were the usage of machine learning is gathering momentum is medicine: machine learning algorithms can detect diseases with high accuracy, they can also be used to predict efficiency of different drug combinations which normally is an extremely time-consuming process."

    "[Figure 1](#ml-model) shows a high level view of the process of building a machine learning model. Everything begins by pre-processing the raw data. After we polish it and make it usable by the machine learning models, we split the **processed data** into two parts: **the training data** and **the testing data**. The **training data** is fed into the model so that it can learn a good mathematical representation of it. The **process of building the model** consist of several  steps. When we build the model, we do not give it all the data that we have. The reasons for the split will become evident in [the train-test split section below](#train-test-split). Then we choose a specific machine learning model. **The model is trained on the training data**. After the model training si done, we can use it to predict some results on the test data, outputing the **predicted outputs**. Given model predictions, we can check how the model has performed. This happens because we iteratively train the model, check how it performs on unseen data and then, if the results are not good we go back to training and repeat the process until we reach some satisfactory results. When it reaches an optimal performance we assume the model is ready to be used in real world scenarions.\n",
    "How do we determine whether a model is performing well or how do we measure the performance it depends on the task at hand. We will see some examples later on.\n"

    "Generally, there are 4 types of machine learning algorithms: *supervised learning*, *unsupervised learning*, *semi-supervised learning* and *reinforcement learning*. In this series of tutorials we will explore supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning** - in this setting we aim to build a model that will learn the data the best and will be able to predict future values. The data points that the model uses to learn, already have the corresponding outputs. This is how the model is able to derive a connection between inputs and outputs. There are two types of problems in the supervised setting: *regression* and *classification*. In **regression**, the output that the model learns and then tries to predict is a continuous value. In **classification**, the output that the model learns and then tries to predict is a categorical value. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning** - in this setting, the data that we have does not have any values or categories that we can learn and later predict. Here, the models will try to find a structure in the data, or learn patterns present. Some use cases of such models would be: clustering, dimensionality reduction, data generation, anomaly detection etc. In the case of clustering, we try to find groups within the data, so that we can group similar samples together. In the case of dimensionality reduction, we move from data with many features, to compressed data, with very few features. \n",

So, to build robust machine learning algorithms, data quality is very important. In most of the cases the data that we get is raw. If we use it as it is, the model may not be able to learn many useful characteristics. Thus, we need to pre-process the data by applying different techniques, so that it can be useful to the model. Below we brief some of these techniques.\n",

Usually we use 70-80% of the whole dataset for training and the remaining 20-30% for testing. The reason that we do this is to be able to quantify how well the model has learned the characteristics of the data. If the performance indicators will be great in the test part than we know that the model has learned the data well.

The reason for all this constraints is that the professors want to evaluate you based on what you have understood from the course. If you already knew the questions of the exam you can easily prepare them beforehand, try to memorize the answers even if you understand nothing and then you get a really good grade from the course.

In our analogy from above, if the students understand the concepts and can put them to practice, then they can be flexible in their jobs and solve tasks that they might not have encountered during the studies.
