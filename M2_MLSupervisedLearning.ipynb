During pre-processing, the raw data undergoes transformations such that it is ready to be used for training. We have already described these steps in Module 1. The pre-processed data is split into train and test sets. During training, the model will use the train set to learn. After the model has been trained on the test set, we use the test set to evaluate the model's performance on an unseen dataset. This is a way of quantifying how well the model has learned the data.

Usually people use intuition, trial-and-error, and other, more sophisticated techniques like cross-validation to pick the right hyperparameters that would make the learning process faster and produce more accurate results (for more on cross-validation see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-validation-explained-evaluating-estimator-performance-e51e5430ff85)).

    "\n",
    "The cost function is a function of the parameters of the model. For example, in regression tasks, a common cost function used is the **mean squared error** (MSE): $$\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2$$, where $y_i$ is the actual value and $\\hat{y_i}$ is the predicted value for sample $i$. Referring to [Figure 2](#regression), $\\hat{y_i}=ax_i + b $ and the cost function can be written as:$$\\text{MSE}=L(a,b)=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (ax_i + b))^2$$. We need to find the values of $a$ and $b$, for which minimum $MSE$ is attained. This can be solved analytically by finding the derivative of $L$ with respect to $a$ and $b$, then equalizing them to 0 and solving them for $a$ and $b$. However, an analytic solution is not always possible. That is why, to find the optimal parameters, algorithms like Gradient Descent are used. Gradient Descent is able to find the optimal solutions by computing the predictions and loss function in multiple iterations. [Figure 4](#gradient-descent) illustrates the process.

We do not want the model to overfit the data, so we set a regularization parameter λ=0.1, to be used during the training process. Since we do not want to wait long, we also determine the number of steps that the loss function will be computed and the weights updated, n=100.* Given this scenario, determine whether a, b, c, λ and n are parameters or hyperparameters."

    "The functions above will help us later when we create, initialize and run the models. The first function `get_train_test_sets()` will take the original dataset as an argument and will return 4 datasets corresponding to the train features, test features, train targets and test targets. The second function, `run_regressor()` will take  a regressor object, the title that will be displayed in the plot and original dataset. It will train the regressor model on the train features and target variables and then will call the `visualize_results()` function. As its name indicates, it will calculate the MSE and R2 in both the train and test sets and will plot the `actual vs predicted ratings` for the target variable of the dataset. \n",

One of the most important hyperparameters that we can finetune is the `max_depth`. Through it we can control how deep the tree will be. The deeper the tree the more likely that the model will learn the dataset by heart and overfit. By keeping the trees shallow, we reduce overfitting. It is important though to find a balance in order to prevent underfitting as well. When initializing the `DecisionTreeRegressor` we pass the `random_state=0` hyperparameter to make the results reproducible. The rest of the procedure is the same as in Linear Regression. This function gets the dataset as a parameter as well."

    "- Compare and contrast the performance of the three types of classifiers. Set `max_depth=4` for both the Decision Tree classifier and the Random Forest classifier. Also, for the random Forest classifier set the `n_estimators=30`. With these hyperparameter settings, compare the performance of the three models. Which performs the best? Where can you see indications of overfitting/underfitting? What are some measures to prevent overfitting/underfitting in our specific case?"

Secondly, we explored the training process, the difference between parameters and hyperparameters, and the notion of cost function. Then we moved on to the evaluation part, where we saw different evaluation metrics used in regression and classification. In the last two sections, we experienced different regression and classification models in action.\n",
