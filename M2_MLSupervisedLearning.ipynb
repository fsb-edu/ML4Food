During pre-processing, the raw data are transformed to prepare the data to be used for training, e.g., by removing outliers and imputing missing values as shown in Module 1. The pre-processed data are split into training and test sets. During training, the model will use the training set to learn. After the model has been trained, we use the test set to evaluate the model's performance on an unseen dataset. This is a way of quantifying how well the model has learned the data.

    "\n",
    "The cost function is a function of the parameters of the model. For example, in regression tasks, a common cost function used is the **mean squared error** (MSE): $$\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y_i})^2$$ where $y_i$ is the actual value and $\\hat{y_i}$ is the predicted value for sample $i$. Referring to [Figure 2](#regression), $\\hat{y_i}=ax_i + b $ and the cost function can be written as:$$\\text{MSE}=L(a,b)=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (ax_i + b))^2$$ We need to find the values of $a$ and $b$, for which minimum $MSE$ is attained. This can be solved analytically by finding the derivative of $L$ with respect to $a$ and $b$, then equalizing them to 0 and solving them for $a$ and $b$. However, an analytic solution is not always possible. That is why, to find the optimal parameters, algorithms like Gradient Descent are used. Gradient Descent is able to find the optimal solutions by computing the predictions and loss function in multiple iterations. [Figure 4](#gradient-descent) illustrates the process.
