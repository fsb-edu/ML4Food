    "Welcome to the second module of this series! In this module you will first get a deeper look on what Unsupervised Learning is and in which scenarios it can be used. Then you will explore two types of problems that unsupervised learning solves: dimensionality reduction and clustering. As you will see, these are not necessarily independent, and can be considered as part of the same pipeline. "

    "In this setting, the data that we have does not have any values or categories that we can learn and later predict. Here, the models will try to find a structure in the data, or learn patterns present. Some use cases of such models would be: clustering, dimensionality reduction, data generation, anomaly detection, etc. \n",

    "In the case of clustering, we try to find groups within the data, so that we can group similar samples together. In the case of dimensionality reduction, we move from data with many features, to compressed data, with very few features. While as the name suggests, in the case of data generation, we use the unlabelled data to learn a structure or underlying properties and based on this, the model will be generate similar samples. For anomaly detection, we can use machine learning models to find outliers in the data. Outliers are points that do not resemble the majority of the points in the dataset. \n",

    "[Fig 1](#unsup_learn) illustrates the machine learning pipeline in case of unsupervised learning. Still there is an output from the models and it outputs what the model has learned from the data. In the case of clustering, it will output a cluster number that will show with which other samples a specific sample is most similar to. In the case of dimensionality reduction, the output will be the sample but with less features. \n",
