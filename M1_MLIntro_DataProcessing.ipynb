    "Welcome to the first module of this series! In this module you will first get an overview on what Machine Learning is and how it can be used in Food Science. Then we will move on to a real-world dataset from the [Swiss Food composition database](https://naehrwertdaten.ch/en/) to learn what data pre-processing steps are needed before applying Machine Learning methods on our data. We will be using this processed dataset in the next two modules on supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning.\n",

    "Machine Learning (ML) has become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives. Text writing programs use ML to autocorrect your texts, search engines use ML to improve your search results, and spam in your email inbox is detected by ML. Although ML has gained significant popularity and widespread use in recent years, it is not a new concept. The term was first coined by Arthur Samuel in 1959. He defined Machine Learning as \"the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\". To rephrase this in simpler terms, one can say that **Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data is essential for any ML method. Depending on the type of data we have, we differentiate between **supervised and unsupervised ML**. If the data we have is labelled and we know the groups within, we can use supervised ML methods. Conversely, if our data is not labelled or we decide to ignore any known labels, we can employ unsupervised ML techniques to identify patterns within. You will learn more about both two types of ML in future modules."

Thus it is important to deal with them. **The process of identifying and handling outliers is called \"outlier detection\".** \n",

    " - **statistical approaches**: calculating mean, standard deviation, quartiles or percentiles of features and identifying data points that fall outside certain ranges or thresholds,\n",
    " - **distance-based methods**: e.g using distances like Euclidean distance to find samples that are far away,\n",
    " - **machine learning techniques**: using clustering, anomaly detection algorithms, etc.\n",
    " \n",
    " You can find a more detailed description of outlier detection methods [here](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-is-outlier-detection/) and [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-identify-outliers-in-data-with-python-a9fe40235064).\n",

Another approach is to use statistical models or machine learning algorithms that are robust to outliers. More  information on outlier handling techniques can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-throw-away-your-outliers-c37e1ab0ce19).\n",

We cannot apply this here because we would have to delete more than 70% of the dataset, meaning that we would have too few samples to do any meaningful analysis. Other approaches are possible for imputing the dataset, e.g. replace the missing values with some characteristic values of the features. For example, we can decide to substitute missing values in a column with the mean value for that feature. Likewise we can substitute them with the median or mode values.

As you can see from [Fig. 1](#ml-model), before the machine learning model is trained, the data is split in two parts: the **training data** and the **testing data**. Usually we use **70-80%** of the whole dataset for training and the remaining **20-30%** for testing. This is done to evaluate how well the model performs on an unseen dataset (the test set). If the model performs well on the test set, it has learned the data well and also manages to generalize to unseen data.

If you already knew the questions of the exam you can easily prepare them beforehand, try to memorize the answers even if you understand nothing and then you get a really good grade from the course.

In our analogy from above, if the students understand the concepts and can put them to practice, then they can be flexible in their jobs and solve tasks that they might not have encountered during the studies.
